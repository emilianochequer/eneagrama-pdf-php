            <h1 class="page-8-text-wrapper">How do you Love?</h1>
            <p class="love-must-be-the">
                Love can be another fighting zone for 8s. Restless you keep demanding what you want from your lovers. In
                love, Enneagram Type 8 individuals are passionate and intense. They tend to approach relationships with
                the same level of determination and focus that they apply to other areas of their lives. They are
                fiercely loyal to their partners and will go to great lengths to protect and defend their loved ones.
                <br /><br />
                You feel good while dominating the relationship and oftenly, try to fit them into your expectations or
                to mold them. That could cause some tension or hurt the bond. But, there is a natural fighting instinct
                in you, if there is no tension and challenges to the relationship you’ll sooner get bored of it. Anyone
                could think that once you are in a safe place, like an intimate bond, you could lower your guard, but
                no, just the opposite. The more vulnerable you feel, the more aggressive you can get. So it’s common to
                be competitive in love.
                <br /><br />
                At the same time, Type 8 individuals are deeply committed to their partners and will work hard to build
                a strong, lasting relationship. You value honesty and authenticity, and you appreciate partners who are
                strong and independent in their own right. You may also be drawn to partners who share their passion for
                social justice and activism.
                <br /><br />
                If you open your heart, your lover must know that’s a huge thing and it must be at the highs with the
                same degree of delivery.
