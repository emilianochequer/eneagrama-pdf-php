            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    Rights may be thinking, “Hey, but how can I be both fearless and in constant fear at the same time?”
                    Honestly, they know it better than anyone. If there’s something the Enneagram teaches us is that
                    opposite sides are not paradoxical, but rather two sides of the same coin.
                    <br /><br />
                    Type 8s fearless attitude comes from their survival instinct: you gotta get what’s yours because
                    nobody’s gonna give you anything. Their shadows and lights come from their courage and
                    self-confidence.

                    In an average state, Enneagram Type 8s are as self-assertive as always, although sometimes they
                    could feel stripped off of resources and silently succumb to fear.
                    <br /><br />
                    To make up for that Eights have to strengthen their methods and expand themselves. They want to feel
                    in control of any situation, and become combative and hostile. Just waiting for the moment to show
                    other people they are in charge or in advantage.
                    <br /><br />
                    The powerful energy of the 8s makes their average a bit extreme. So, imagine the strength that they
                    carry on their hands. But, as Uncle Ben once said: “With great power comes great responsibility”.
