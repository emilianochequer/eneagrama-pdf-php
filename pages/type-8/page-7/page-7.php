            I can see a Type 8 walking through long halls in slow motion while [insert soundtrack here] plays in the
            background. Enneagram Eights are the lions of the Enneagram.
            <br /><br />
            They love to be in charge, doing things their way as they think that’s the best for everyone. They may
            strive for success in their careers or personal lives, seeking positions of authority or leadership roles.
            They may also be drawn to challenges or situations that allow them to prove their strength or dominance.
            They are often passionate about causes they believe in and are willing to stand up for what they believe is
            right, even in the face of opposition or adversity.
            <br /><br />
            We appreciate that, 8s (shaking). Enneagram 8s life is based on protecting themselves from everything and
            everyone, but with an aggressive response. They don’t wait for the world to attack, they go first. Eights
            impact and establish what they want. Nothing more, nothing less… ok, maybe more is better.

            Being soft? That’s for marshmallows. As they see you, they treat you. That’s why the Challenger worked
            really hard to build their powerful and respectable persona.
            <br /><br />
            They think the world is tough – and they’re not wrong – but it makes them always be on guard. Nobody
            challenges them easily, and if someone dares to, Eights fight back even harder. Enforcing their
            self-confidence and self-assertive attitude.
            <br /><br />
            People see Enneagram 8s as huge and unbreakable, and this image they project also reinforces their own
            beliefs. It’s easy for them to go around with their heart bursting with pride. Type 8s think their value
            relies on always being in control. Otherwise, they feel helpless and scared to death of being hurt.
