                            with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it gives different inputs into your relationship and
                            lead to new levels of healthiness. However, it is important to know that no pairing of types
                            is particularly blessed or ruined: knowing these combinations will help you understand some
                            of the different features that may come from the mix between two different types.
                            <br /><br />
                            @name keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            Enneagram type 8s and Enneagram Type 1s (Reformers) have many similarities. One of them is
                            their true desire to fight for truth and justice. Although it might be in different ways and
                            for many different reasons, they often feel that it’s their responsibility to stand against
                            injustice or inequity whenever they see it. Both Enneagram types tend to perceive themselves
                            as people whose duty is to protect the weak and defenseless, to fight the wrong and to make
                            the world a better place.
                            <br /><br />
                            Both these types are action-oriented. So, if they point their energy and attention towards
                            social causes, they will achieve big goals not only for their family, but also for their
                            community, country and the world itself. Both of them are willing to make big sacrifices for
                            what they believe is right. They are known for their virtue, vision, purposefulness,
                            practicality and perseverance in supporting whatever they believe in. Generally speaking,
                            Enneagram type 1s bring a sense of ideal truths and justice to the table whereas Enneagram
                            type 7s bring a more practical and immediate approach to these concepts held by Reformers.
                            This combination can be truly powerful: as they have a clear sense of purpose and an
                            unequivocal personal mission, they can achieve many things together.

                            On one hand, Ones can find Eights to be exciting, fun, passionate and physical – all traits
                            they generally repress. On the other hand, Eights admire Ones conviction and recognize that
                            Ones are as firm, decisive, purposed and determined as they are.
