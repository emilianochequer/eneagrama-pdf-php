                >It’s important to take into account that the same motives that
                once united them can be the ones that will break them up: their
                striking differences, as if they were ice and fire. They can
                easily be friends or colleagues but they make a particularly
                rare romantic match making intimacy between them a little rough.
                First, both of them want to be in charge and accomplish
                significant things (nothing bad, right?). Nevertheless,
                sometimes it’s impossible for them to agree on the means and
                paths to be taken.<br /><br />On one hand, Ones tend to be
                self-controlled and inflexible. They often deny themselves the
                pleasure of acting on their real desires and impulses due to
                their moral convictions and inflexibility. That is one of the
                reasons why they admire the ideas, freedom and creativity of
                Eights: they go after whatever they want. <br /><br />However,
                when Ones see their partners going too far in the pursuit of
                their self-interest, they might consider them as selfish,
                insensitive, untrustworthy and self- centered. They admire their
                bravery but they know how much chaos and destruction it could
                create in their lives.<br /><br />On the other hand, Eights
                consider Ones as hypocrite, rigid, self-righteous, and utterly
                unrealistic about the way the world works. Often Eights will act
                outrageously to provoke morally judgmental Ones. In these
                situations, both respond with anger and get into rigid positions
                and feel they can’t back down. Violent arguments may also arise
                ending in personal attacks. In these types of relationships
                solutions might be difficult to find once a certain line has
                been crossed.</span

          <p>Enneagram Type 1 In A Relationship With Type 9</p>

              ><span class="data-container-span2"
                ><br />Enneagram type 1s (Reformers) and Enneagram type 9s
                (Peacemakers) understand each other from within and can see many
                of their own traits in their partner, which can be a good or a
                bad thing. As for the positive side of this connection, each
                Enneagram type brings a certain idealism and a desire to change
                the world and make it a better place, as they are both
                hardworking types that are willing to sacrifice themselves and
                put their personal needs aside for the sake of others.<br /><br />Ones
                contribute with reasoning and clarity and their ability to
                articulate different ideals into one. They are always looking
                for improvement, they are reasonable, fair, consistent and have
                high ethical and moral standards. Also, Ones feel that they have
                a mission in life, and they are able to inspire Nines to become
                aware of their own purpose and to follow it. While Nines are
                easy to get along with, steady, and simple. As they are
                uncritical and undemanding, they have the quality to nurture and
                support people around them without much pressure.<br /><br />They
                prefer harmony and smooth relations over the pleasure of being
                right or having the last word in an argument. This mix has what
                it takes to be an altruistic pair: a romantic match that
                balances idealism and humanity. As a romantic couple, they feel
                pleased by having company over and are always generous and
                friendly. However, they also value their time together as a
                couple. They both enjoy nature and animals, as well as children
                and family.</span
