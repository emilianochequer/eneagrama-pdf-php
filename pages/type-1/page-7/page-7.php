            History is nothing more or less than “The story of human passions”:
            strong people doing big things, moved by their passions, their ideals,
            and trusting themselves. In the same way, intuition tells Enneagram 1s
            what’s best, but it’s not a leap of faith. They know that they’ll
            accomplish their mission after going a long way. <br /><br />When
            Enneagram ones find out something that’s important to them, it becomes
            their purpose, the very thing that moves their life forward and measures
            reality. They can transform things, make the world a better place.
            That’s really hard work on Enneagram 1s shoulders but it’s also what
            guides them to the highest feelings and brings them to their best
            version. <br /><br />Just like free horses running wildly with blinders
            trust their legs, an Enneagram type one runs across the field relying on
            their ideals.

            The Reformer’s principles are like law to them, so they feel the need to
            follow them strictly. Knowing what is right and wrong, makes Enneagram
            type ones very practical people who easily know what to do. Although
            this could also drive them to self-repression to get what needs to be
            done done. It doesn’t feel bad at that moment since Enneagram 1s believe
            their worth depends on doing what’s right. That’s how they end up
            transferring their self value over to their values. <br /><br />With a
            high sense of justice and responsibility, Enneagram type ones stand up
            for their convictions. Their self-awareness allows them to be reflexive
            and honest with themselves, even though they tend to oversee their
            behavior instead of having a compassionate look towards themselves.
            Somebody has to do it to keep order.
