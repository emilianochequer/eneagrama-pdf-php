                though these two make a great mix, they’re also opposites in
                important areas which can eventually lead to confrontations and
                a sudden break up. On the one hand, Enneagram type 1s have the
                tendency to believe in the objectivity of certain truths and
                their conviction. They feel that all of their ideals, values and
                philosophy have given them some form of ultimate Truth, and they
                live according to it.<br /><br />On the other hand, Enneagram
                type 5 doesn’t believe in an objective truth. They think there
                are endless interpretations of any reality and, although people
                may reach a certain degree of consensus, that does not mean that
                it reflects anything completely objective. It just means that
                there are groups of people that out of faith or conviction
                decide to think the same way.<br /><br />In a relationship, both
                parties find it difficult to open their minds and change their
                own life philosophy. Ones can divert into different types of
                fundamentalism while Fives may become provoking nihilists and
                they both find it difficult to fully empathize with someone that
                thinks differently. Ones can sometimes feel like Enneagram 5s
                are impractical and concerned with irrelevant stuff, while Fives
                might feel that Enneagram 1s are too rigid and serious.<br /><br />If
                they don’t find a way to understand their differences and accept
                each other’s opinions, coldness and isolation may come into the
                relationship and last for years. They might become too
                self-sufficient and live their lives in completely separate
                spheres and only get together for occasional social events, to
                sleep, or to solve urgent issues.</span

            Enneagram Type 1 In A Relationship With Type 6

              ><span class="data-container-second-span2"
                ><br />Enneagram type 1 (Reformers) and Enneagram type 6
                (Loyalists) are similar in many ways. They are usually
                recognized for being hard-workers, serious-minded people with a
                strong sense of duty and honor. <br /><br />They both honor
                truth and commitment, and they also desire to serve people
                around them and make the world a better place. These Enneagram
                types have a strong sense of purpose, often led by strong
                beliefs and ideals. On one hand, Ones bring reasoning, calmness
                and clarity to the relationship, along with the ability to think
                clearly under pressure and the ability to make big decisions
                quickly.<br /><br />They are pretty sure of themselves and their
                opinions; so, Enneagram type 1s often serve as the leader in a
                One-Six relationship. They’re the ones in charge of decision
                making and are responsible for any eventual results that might
                come from it. They also bring a concern for order and
                consistency, logic and elegance (traits that Enneagram type 6
                might lack).<br /><br />On the other hand, Loyalists bring
                warmth, emotional responsibility, generosity and playfulness,
                which Reformers think it’s adorable and makes them think twice
                about their mindsets. They also have the ability to connect with
                people in a more direct and human way than Reformers. If their
                fundamental beliefs are in alignment, these qualities are really
                attractive to Reformers and can make this couple a dynamic and
                stable one.
