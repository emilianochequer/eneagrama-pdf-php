        But without kindness and patience they can also be their own tyrant.
        <br /><br />Sometimes Type Ones can worry about being inconsistent or
        about people noticing that they are not adjusted perfectly to their own
        ideals, which can make them feel constantly seen or tense.

        When The Reformer is in an unhealthy state of mind nothing is ever
        enough for them, especially themselves (They should avoid getting into
        mirror labyrinths in those times). <br /><br />Type Ones are like dogs
        that try to bite their own tail, or a kid scared of its own shadow.

            As you can see, if Enneagram 1s stick to their commitment to their
            ideals or thoughts, it will be difficult for them to deal with
            unexpected situations or disruptions, or even take advantage of
            them.
            <br /><br />They can’t tolerate things they can’t control and if
            Type Ones just push themselves out of the line for a moment they
            feel betrayed. <br /><br />They need to learn to forgive themselves.

            Enneagram Type 1 usually tries to ease their anger. They feel that
            by controlling it they will keep their integrity and balance.
            <br /><br />Anger is a very intense emotion, and so it may feel
            excessive, out of limit.<br /><br />To overcome anger, Enneagram 1
            types need to yield and listen to it. <br /><br />Keeping an open
            mind will help them cope with reality and increase their potential
            to change.
