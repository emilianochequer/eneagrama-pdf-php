            >This Enneagram compatibility is task-oriented and both sides are
            driven to working. They are constantly aware of their own high
            expectations and standards. <br /><br />Both types can provide
            self-discipline, hard work, and an amazing ability to put aside
            their personal feelings for the sake of their goals. They are so
            used to working hard that they usually prosper, which makes everyone
            around admire them and leads them to leadership roles with lots of
            responsibility. This goal- oriented match strives for excellence and
            therefore they are extraordinarily competent and impressive. These
            skills are useful when it comes to practical matters, such as
            planning and organizing, as they can objectively assign
            responsibilities according to people’s abilities. <br /><br />This
            mixed pair is capable of dealing with everything. They will try to
            solve personal problems by discussing specific issues as neither of
            them likes emotionally charged arguments or unresolved arguments.
            Type 1s help type 3s to be more grounded and realistic; while Threes
            teach Ones to not be such perfectionists. This is a romantic match
            in which both sides are persistent, efficient and concerned with
            excellence and making a real difference in the world.</span

                >What are the potential trouble spots for these types? Whenever
                this match has a problem, it’s often due to having too many
                obligations, a lack of emotional attachment to each other, and a
                strong sense of competition. On one hand, Ones tend to find
                Threes too pragmatic, workaholic, and concerned with their
                social image and reputation rather than their principles and
                values. They also criticize Threes for pragmatically changing
                their goals, whenever they drop down the efforts when something
                isn’t working for them. Ones can also take an issue when Threes
                don’t own their personal behavior including disloyalty to their
                partner.<br /><br />On the other hand, Thress tend to find Ones
                too strict, inflexible and judgmental in different areas.
                Whereas Threes generally value Ones’ ability to get things done,
                Threes can also feel that Ones are way too narrow-minded,
                methodical and focused on details rather than results. They may
                also have issues with Ones when they feel they are being judged
                not only for their attitude but also for their actions.<br /><br />In
                conclusion, one side of this relationship feels overwhelmed and
                constantly criticized. Eventually, both gradually lose respect
                for the other: Ones lose respect for Threes integrity, and
                Threes lose respect for Ones’ effectiveness. A sudden break up
                may happen. However, if both find the bond to be useful for
                them, they can keep a professional relationship that doesn’t
                have the passion but is still beneficial to both parties for
                their personal status and professional success.</span
