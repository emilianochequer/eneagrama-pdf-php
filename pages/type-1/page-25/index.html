                Enneagram type Twos provides the care and the feelings that type
                Ones don’t easily allow themselves to have. Twos are also more
                welcoming than Ones and can warm up even the most reserved
                kinds.<br /><br />They bring not only warmth to the table, but
                are also aware of suffering and work hard and generously to help
                people in need: they definitely help reformers soften up and
                relax. Ones, on the other hand, bring integrity, consciousness,
                commitment, and consistency since they are steady, reliable, and
                truthful. Ones commit strongly, which makes Twos feel calm and
                secure.</span

                Now… what are the potential issues between them? Although Ones
                and Twos are constantly concerned about other people’s needs,
                they are not always aware of their very own needs nor are they
                able to easily express them. Ones (Reformers) take life
                seriously and their responsibilities always come before
                leisure.<br /><br />Twos (Helpers) feel they must take care of
                everyone else’s needs before they take care of their own. For
                them, life is about helping others and being useful, which is
                the only way they feel accepted. This means that, both Ones and
                Twos, find it difficult to talk about what and how they feel
                about the relationship and what they actually want. In this kind
                of relationship, there are often many unsaid feelings or
                desires: each type find it difficult to admit that they are not
                getting what they want or are not feeling happy and
                fulfilled.<br /><br />For both of them, getting what they want
                feels selfish and forbidden. On one hand, Ones may feel
                disappointed by their partner’s tendency to give so much to
                others and not regulating time and attention. For Ones, their
                romantic partner is always everywhere but home or their job’s
                where they should be fulfilling their primary responsibilities.
                <br /><br />On the other hand, Twos can see Ones as too
                impersonal and unconcerned with others. When this happens, they
                might feel disappointed on Ones. They believe their partner
                loves humanity but have problems committing to real people. All
                of these differences can lead both sides to get judgmental and
                critical of each other while the relationship drifts apart.<br />
