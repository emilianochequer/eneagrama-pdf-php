            When they feel overwhelmed by the world and don’t know where to
            start, they get lost in disappointment with a touch of shame and
            anger. They will usually overpressure themselves to achieve
            particular goals. This can really affect their relationships as they
            put a lot of effort into solving and changing things. However,
            sometimes it’s best to just let life do what it does best: sort
            things out. Although that’s something Enneagram type 1s love to do.
            Losing sight of their beloved ones just to try to catch up with
            their purposes makes them really unhappy and can push them into an
            unhealthy cycle.

            They are essential. Whatever the career they’re in, they stand out
            and broaden their field of action. They don’t take NO for an answer
            when they know what needs to be done. In a healthy state, the
            Enneagram type 1 wing 9 can shine and establish new paths and
            perspectives. Their ideals and the conviction that lights their
            fire, encourage them to share everything they know with others and
            to express what they’ve seen so other people can be part of the
            change. Instead of withdrawing, they make big decisions by taking
            control of the boat, making it ready to sail into the horizon.<br />

            In bad times, they fall into the “impostor syndrome”, feeling they
            aren’t good enough. The Idealist can get quite self-repressive. In
            the same way they can be patient with other people’s mistakes and
            setbacks, they won’t be patient with themselves. The bar for them is
            always too high, which can make frustration take over. They knock on
            heaven’s door, but on the other side there is nothing but a mirror
            they should use to look at themselves, and start a new world with
            self-love.
