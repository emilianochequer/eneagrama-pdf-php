            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    that Enneagram 1s have a best or a worst part will help
                    please that inner self that is always judging them. But ok, let’s
                    play that game for a while and watch a Type 1 close their window and
                    look at other people between the sunblind spaces.
                    <br /><br />Growling softly like Gollum. Let’s say they are always
                    following the “Precious”. That’s great. It could make Enneagram 1
                    unwavering, but if they obsess over it they can run into unhealthy
                    behaviors that make them very self-demanding and disconnected from
                    other people. Then Ones run into the risk of missing the beauty of
                    diversity and alternative paths.</span></span>

                    On a common day, Type Ones are energetic and purposeful. Always trying
                    to take meaningful actions with an organized schedule. It’s not
                    difficult for them to focus and determine what is right from what is
                    not. <br /><br />So there Enneagram 1s go, walking through life with
                    their ideal bars, measuring everything that comes across them (If Type
                    ones wonder why raccoons and squirrels run from them, here’s why).
                    <br /><br />Enneagram 1s have wonderful ideas on how to change things
                    for the better. They also have a stubborn conviction, which is
                    fundamental to materialize projects and that makes a Type One a
                    natural leader most of the time.
