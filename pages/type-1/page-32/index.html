          In this scenario, pursuing different options within the relationship
          gets more and more attractive to Enthusiasts since they reject the
          idea of feeling trapped in a relationship that makes them unhappy. If
          the situation continues to deteriorate, Reformers will lose respect
          for their partner, becoming pushier and demanding. Enthusiasts will
          try to avoid their company and might feel let down and depressed,
          taking all types of emotional connection away from Ones.<br /><br />Both
          of them might adopt an indifferent attitude towards each other, making
          reaching an agreement and compromise even more difficult. Eventually,
          Ones will criticize their partner for a certain period, until some
          event casts the fatal blow to the relationship.

            Enneagram Type 1 In A Relationship With Type 8

                ><br />Enneagram type 1s and Enneagram Type 8s (Challengers)
                have many similarities. One of them is their true desire to
                fight for truth and justice. Although it might be in different
                ways and for many different reasons, they often feel that it’s
                their responsibility to stand against injustice or inequity
                whenever they see it. Both Enneagram types tend to perceive
                themselves as people whose duty is to protect the weak and
                defenseless, to fight the wrong and to make the world a better
                place.<br /><br />Both these types are action-oriented. So, if
                they point their energy and attention towards social causes,
                they will achieve big goals not only for their family, but also
                for their community, country and the world itself. Both of them
                are willing to make big sacrifices for what they believe is
                right. <br /><br />They are known for their virtue, vision,
                purposefulness, practicality and perseverance in supporting
                whatever they believe in. Generally speaking, Enneagram type 1s
                bring a sense of ideal truths and justice to the table whereas
                Enneagram type 7s bring a more practical and immediate approach
                to these concepts held by Reformers. This combination can be
                truly powerful: as they have a clear sense of purpose and an
                unequivocal personal mission, they can achieve many things
                together.<br /><br />On one hand, Ones can find Eights to be
                exciting, fun, passionate and physical – all traits they
                generally repress. On the other hand, Eights admire Ones
                conviction and recognize that Ones are as firm, decisive,
                purposed and determined as they are. Although some people think
                that these two types are opposites, they can both learn a lot
                from each other, making their relationship a really nutritive
                one. All of this is possible if they are willing to be
                open-minded and accept different reactions, values and
                ideas.</span
