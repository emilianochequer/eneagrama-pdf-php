                ><br />The main conflict between Sixes and Nines is that they
                never say what is actually on their minds or what they really
                want for themselves. As a consequence, they are usually
                stubborn, quiet and tend to make others guess what is going on.
                <br /><br />Enneagrams Sixes and Nines will try to hold back
                conflicts and confrontations until they’re pushed to the limit,
                although Sixes have a shorter fuse when it comes to their
                emotions. When this happens, the relationship can end in an
                impasse: they will draw away from each other, but not all the
                way.<br /><br />Apart from that, they both like familiar things
                and struggle facing constant changes, which they truly dislike.
                They tend to feel that familiarity offers them stability and
                security, which is reinforced by the conviction that they must
                remain quiet and not make noise. Another potential problem for
                them has to do with their priorities. Both these Enneagram types
                like fulfilling their social roles but they tend to withdraw
                completely whenever they need to.<br /><br />On one hand, Sixes
                prioritize doing whatever they have to do to keep their lives in
                place. If they don’t, they may have a guilt trip. On the other,
                Nines also fulfill their social roles, but they usually adjust
                to others even if their own stress and instability grows. Their
                different priorities can eventually lead to confrontations and
                an unavoidable break up.<br /><br /><br /><br /></span
