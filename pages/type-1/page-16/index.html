          The Enneagram 1 wing 9 type will have to learn how to flow with life
          by channeling their true feelings and facing their vulnerabilities.
          This sensitivity will make them wiser and more relaxed with
          themselves. The world needs the idealist to be ok with its own self so
          the fire will light the beginning of new times.

                Between 9’s fear of loss and separation and 1’s fear of being
                corrupt or defective, it’s easy to understand why Enneagram type
                1 wing 9‘s main fear is to feel trapped in an unjust and unequal
                world that’s not worthy of them. Or worse, they fear this world
                might be a reflection of their inner world. They strive to be
                better and, in that constant pursuit, they don’t want to lose
                sight of what’s important: their beloved ones.
                <br />
                <br />
                The idealist frequently withdraws into their inner self to avoid
                exposing their traps. They accept their own inconsistencies, so
                they often bark at their own shadows.

                Enneagram type 1 wing 9‘s most basic desire is to reach the
                highest version of things. <br />
                <br />
                As they can easily discern right from wrong, they want other
                people to see things the same way they see them. Enneagram 1
                wing 9 types typically shine brighter in calm environments where
                people are open to hear and share. Under the right conditions,
                they become truly inspirational and motivational people. <br />
                <br />
                Otherwise, when surrounded by conflict, they will withdraw and
                avoid any negative feelings. As they have a hard time managing
                these situations, they can’t really enjoy them and set
                boundaries without feeling confused.
