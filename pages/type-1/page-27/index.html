            Enneagram Type 1 In A Relationship With Type 4

                How Does Each Enneagram Type Enhance the Relationship?

                >Enneagram type 1s (Reformers) and Enneagram type 4s
                (Individualists) have a mutual interest in giving something
                beautiful to the world. Both of them are dreamy, idealistic and
                are really concerned about doing their work and self-expressions
                well. They are visionaries that look at projects or things and
                imagine how they could be different and even be better if things
                go as planned. If they work together, it could result in
                something limitless, magic and transcendent.<br /><br />On one
                hand, Enneagram type 1s usually offer truth, objectivity,
                reasoning and value to the relationship. They also bring
                self-discipline, good work habits, and regularity. Ones are
                aware of their own needs and change them for the greater good, a
                specific vision or goal (including the ones they see as the core
                of the relationship itself.)<br /><br />On the other hand, Fours
                bring in all their sensuality, spontaneity, creativity,
                inspiration, intense feelings, and the power of the unconscious.
                Their sensitivity and emotions can balance One’s typical
                formality and sense of order as they give One a permission to
                explore and fully express the variety of feelings and passions
                within them. Generally speaking, Ones bring boundaries and
                self-restraint to the relationship, which can work as a role
                model for Fours, who tend to be more unregulated.<br /><br />Both
                Enneagram types have a taste for refinement, beauty and arts,
                and if both value what the other has to offer, they can form a
                long-lasting and productive bond that helps balance each side’s
                limitations while bringing out qualities each of them
                lacks.</span

                >The love relationships involving an Enneagram type One and an
                Enneagram type Four can sometimes feel like mixing oil and
                water: they tend to disagree a lot and often quickly break up
                because they definitely see things from opposite perspectives.
                <br /><br />While Reformers see themselves as reasonable and
                objective people, Individualists interpret different events
                using a subjective and personal perspective even when trying to
                be objective. Although both bring some kind of idealism to the
                relationship, their idealism is utterly different: Ones are
                drawn to social, political and moral causes while Fours are
                concerned about their personal lives.</span
