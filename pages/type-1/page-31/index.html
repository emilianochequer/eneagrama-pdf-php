            Reformers bring dutifulness, order, steadiness, attention to detail,
            and a profound appreciation for high standards to the relationship.
            While Enthusiasts bring curiosity, energy, fun and adventure. And
            also, a desire to live new experiences and give everything they can
            a try. Both of them love planning. They are future-oriented and
            idealistic.
            <br /><br />However, Enneagram type 7s prefer having a wide range of
            options and keep all plans open to change whenever they need to.
            They bring spontaneity and freedom to the relationship. As opposed
            to Enneagram type 1s more methodical manners that help Enneagram
            type 7s stay on track.<br /><br />Enthusiasts offer Reformers
            excitement and the ability to think of life as a source of pleasure
            and enjoyment, not just work. Enthusiasts maintain Reformers’
            spirits up, refreshing their idealism while preventing the
            relationship from getting too intense. Ones offer Sevens a sense of
            perfection, idealism and direction. They help type 7s get stable
            while they keep on working systematically and consistently toward
            goals. Enthusiasts appreciate their partner’s harmony and
            reliability and are glad to have someone who can keep an eye on
            details.<br /><br />This couple will be really supportive of each
            other as long as they have similar values and are both working
            towards the same goals. This relationship has the potential to be
            really stimulating for both since they are able to support each
            other while also feeling challenged by their differences.

                ><br />Although the compatibility between these two Enneagram
                types is high, during stressful situations, some issues may
                arise.<br /><br />On one hand, Ones can be critical, inflexible,
                judgmental, and closed-minded. They will insist that things must
                be done one specific way: their way. And will, inevitably, think
                of Sevens as inefficient, undisciplined, innocent and naive.
                Enneagram type 1s consider that type 7s tend to fool around way
                too much, that they over withdraw to themselves and promise way
                too much to way too many people. They will also often feel that
                their Enthusiast match is unfocused and distracted simply to
                annoy them. On the other hand, Sevens will probably think of
                Ones as inflexible, closed-minded and perfectionistic.<br /><br />Conflicts
                between these two also arise in organizational and financial
                matters: Ones might feel that Sevens are wasteful and immoderate
                while Sevens might feel that their partners are tight-fisted and
                boring.</span
