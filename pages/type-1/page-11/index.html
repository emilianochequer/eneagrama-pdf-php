            However, they do so very differently. Enneagram Type 9 seems to move
            away from instinct, while Enneagram Type 8 and Enneagram Type 1
            respectively over and under express what their instinct says to
            them.
            <br /><br />As they lose control, the three members of this
            Enneagram Triad have to deal with anger either by letting it out or
            repressing it. It’s their gut they trust to determine whether the
            surroundings are safe or even fair, and any lack of balance can make
            these Enneatypes very uncomfortable. That’s when their defense
            mechanisms kick in.

                what needs to be changed and what’s not fair, so they can take
