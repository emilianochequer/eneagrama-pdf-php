          What makes Enneagram type 1 wing 2 special is the fact that they’re
          still wise, principled, and ethical while having a more interpersonal
          consciousness. <br /><br />They are more empathetic and aware of other
          people’s needs, which enforces their sense of equality and justice.<br /><br />The
          brilliant aspect of Enneagram type 1 wing 2 is that the typical
          stubbornness of its core (type 1) is tamed by the deep sense of
          compassion and the giving nature of the predominant wing (2).

        They know what’s right and what’s wrong, what needs to be done and they
        have the courage to overcome the obstacles ahead of them with a warm and
        open-hearted attitude. They are receptive and able to cope with
        conflicts with determination.<br /><br />Enneagram type 1 wing 2 usually
        chooses careers that involve being in contact with people, which
        improves their interpersonal skills and rhetoric. They work hard to
        leave a mark as they have a broad reality consciousness and are fully
        aware of people’s changing power.
