          This couple really takes responsibility in relationships and, as they
          can count on each other, they have room to relax. This romantic match
          not only shares burdens and chores equally, but they also feel that
          they can count on each other since they are steadfast, loyal, and
          faithful to each other.

                ><br />What could be the potential clashes in their
                relationship? During stressful situations, Reformers generally
                become more critical of everyone, including themselves and their
                partner. As they are a clear example of “just responsibilities,
                no fun”, it gets difficult to be around them even in the average
                levels. Type 1s might feel that type 6s aren’t trying enough,
                aren’t serious enough, or aren’t mature or meticulous enough. At
                least not as much as Ones are, which can often lead to
                accusations and resentment.<br /><br />As Reformers get more and
                more stressed, their partner gets more and more emotionally
                reactive, insecure, and worried. What Loyalists sees instead is
                a partner that is critical, and rejecting, which can make them
                feel even more insecure and anxious. This can lead to Loyalists
                questioning the future of the relationship or feeling that it
                isn’t meant to be. If tensions continue, type 6s will get
                increasingly defensive and evasive; they will also tend to work
                longer hours than they used to in order to stay away from home
                and avoid spending time with their partners.<br /><br />They
                start getting absent or doing just the bare minimum. They will
                also find it difficult to talk directly about their feelings and
                fears. As a result, there will be little to no communication
                between them. In this scenario, they can get even more
                inconsistent and unreliable for their partners and these
                reactions can fuel type 1’s disappointment, frustration and
                resentment. In the worst-case scenario, Reformers may find
                Loyalists’ anxiety and defensiveness quite frustrating and might
                get angry, cold and critical towards them. Anger, resentment,
                and accusations can be part of the picture as the relationship
                deteriorates.</span

                Enneagram type 1s (Reformers) and Enneagram type 7 (Enthusiasts)
                can easily achieve a complementary and reciprocal relationship.
                They are kind of opposite poles that can either provide
                something their partner lacks, helping both of them to achieve a
                new level of growth or, in the worst-case scenario, drive each
                other apart by playing around with each other’s weaknesses.<br /></span
