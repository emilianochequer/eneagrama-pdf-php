                Now… What are the potential trouble spots between them? Both
                Enneagram type 1s are marked by a strong sense of right and
                wrong as well as a sense of responsibility, and the need to
                fight for tolerance, dignity, and people’s rights.
                <br /><br />These attributes give them a feeling of
                self-restraint and a tendency to feel responsible for themselves
                and for everything else in their lives: each of them will take
                the adult role in most situations, making for a highly competent
                and rational approach to life. Although these qualities are
                positive ones, they can also be overwhelming since there might
                be a noticeable tone of formality in this combination with a
                reluctance to say or do anything that would be undignified or
                not appropriate and very little tolerance for sloppiness or
                error.<br /><br />There is also a strong tendency to feel easily
                frustrated by mistakes. Irony, annoyance, and sarcasm are some
                of the ways they use to express anger towards each other.
                Occasionally exploding into a litany of old complaints.<br /><br />Depending
                on their own health level, double 1 couples may struggle to find
                people that measure up to their high standards, resulting in
                fewer social interactions and an increasing self-imposed
                isolation. Their rigidness, perfectionism, determination, and
                low- tolerance make it really hard for them to establish
                superficial interactions or small talk with people they have
                just met.<br /><br />Actually, this couple may bond by their
                outrage towards errors and other people’s foolishness. It is not
                rare to find some eccentricity and unusual habits (personally
                and also as a couple) which lead them to withdraw from most
                human connections.<br /><br />Double Ones can feel like they are
                each other’s shelter, a place where values, ideals, and
                connections are profound and undeniable. In this Enneagram
                compatibility, both sides might feel like they are all they need
                in the world; however, it can turn into a cold and unforgiving
                world if they start to barely stand each other.<br

                ><br />Enneagram type 1s (Reformers) and Enneagram type 2s
                (Helpers) are a complementary match as both of them offer each
                other a taste of their own traits. Both are achievers that are
                drawn to jobs or roles that allow them to help others. They
                generally work as teachers, ministers or health care volunteers,
                who work long hours, put up with a lot of pressure and have a
                lot of responsibility on their shoulders. These types of couples
                are often made of professionals who aren’t home for most of the
                day, sometimes even a few days. Their usually focus mostly on
                their occupation, even more so than the relationship itself.<br /><br />This
                Enneagram compatibility often involve mature and independent
                people that are able to fulfill their emotional needs by bonding
                with a variety of people and connections, including their
                professional ones. They usually provide high ideals, strong
                ethical standards, and a strong desire to serve others. Since
                the relationship is built on the basis of these values (both are
                sort of on the same path) it’s easier for them to keep a strong
                relationship that’s in</span
