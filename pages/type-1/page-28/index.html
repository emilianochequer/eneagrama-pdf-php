          As both like taking care of their own self-image, they end up
          reinforcing each other’s sense of superiority, often resulting in
          elitism, disdain and snobbery toward others: specially those who have
          less, or also people with a different taste or sense of refinement.
          One of the main conflicts between Reformers and Individualists is in
          the self-discipline vs. self-indulgence area, between personal and
          emotional impulses. Ones may find Fours to be hopelessly emotional and
          self-indulgent, while Fours may find Ones to be cold, rigid and
          judgmental.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Ones and Fours may
          displease each other just for being what they are instead of an ideal
          and unreal version of themselves. The relationship between them can
          deteriorate into frustration and end as a result of bitter arguments
          and wounds form the past.

            Enneagram Type 6 In A Relationship With Type 5

              ><span class="data-container-span2"
                ><br />Enneagram type 1 (Reformers) and Enneagram type 5
                (Investigators) are alike in many ways, especially in their
                reluctance to express their emotions directly. Although Fives
                are more mental and Ones like their ideas and philosophies to
                have practical ramifications; both consider themselves empirical
                people.<br /><br />They both provide objectivity to the
                relationship to avoid falling into sentimentalism. That’ how
                they protect their mental clarity. Also, both of them share a
                rich mentally stimulating life, full of curiosity and mutual
                interests.<br /><br />This is one of the many reasons Ones and
                Fives enjoy each other’s company. In their relationship there’s
                always room for intellectual stimulation, debating and
                admiration for each other’s expertise and intelligence. This
                couple is highly respectful of each other’s boundaries: they
                don’t usually make the first move unless they have pretty strong
                signals that they will be welcomed. This is how Ones and Fives
                bring certain formality and courtesy to the relationship, which
                can make the couple seem a little old-fashioned.<br /><br />On
                one hand, Enneagram type 1s bring logic and order, attention to
                details, systematic thinking, and a desire to improve the world
                around them. <br /><br />On the other hand, Enneagram type 5s
                bring curiosity, a profound taste for the bizarre and illogical
                and fondness for disorder, chaos, and lack of apparent purpose.
                If romance between Reformers and Investigators develops, it will
                be slowly but deeply.</span
