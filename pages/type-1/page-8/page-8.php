            <h1 class="page-8-text-wrapper">How do you Love?</h1>
            <p class="love-must-be-the">
                Love must be the most unbalancing experience we all go through. The
                Reformer knows that better than anyone. Not because it actually
                disbalances them, but because Enneagram Ones are aware of the risk and
                keep a sharp eye on their significant other’s values too. <br />
                <br />
                It’s important to share principles and perspectives since they are the
                ground, the solid base upon which you can build anything. So when it
                comes to love, Type Ones are very concerned about the other’s ideals,
                and they have their red flags very clearly established. <br />
                <br />
                The problem is when they try to adjust that other person to their
                ideals, which can bring disagreements and disappointments. Here is
                where Enneagram 1s learn to be more flexible, and open-minded towards
                other ways of life while still living theirs. <br />
                <br />
                Sometimes it is good to only gaze at people for a while to discover
                the beauty and ideals they conjugate.
