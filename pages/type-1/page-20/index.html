            At a healthy state, The Reformer feels calm, pleased with themselves
            and their environment. They achieve an emotional independence, free
            of external acceptance or third party approval because Type Ones are
            aligned with their own very intimate purpose. It’s ok to be them.
            They are on the “correct” path. <br /><br />Constantly learning and
            becoming more comprehensive with their own pace makes it easier for
            Type Ones to understand other’s rhythm too. <br /><br />They feel
            inspired by their own dreams. Doing what they have to do in order to
            achieve bigger goals is what makes Enneagram 1s feel comfortable and
            vibrant.<br /><br />The Reformer Type are now wise, keeping both
            feet on the ground and their heart up in the sky. They know and
            accept reality, and they don’t fight it out anymore because they’ve
            discovered that there is where the power of transformation lies.<br /><br />As
            Eckhart Tolle says:“Whatever you fight, you strengthen, and what you
            resist, persists.”

            They treasure a determinant energy to face reality with a high sense
            of justice and altruism. Empathy is fundamental for them to identify
            other people’s needs, which they quickly make their own. People love
            to hear their speeches. Inspirational and clarifying, the enneagram
            1W2, is an innate speaker.<br />As every human, they want to feel
            loved but for them this is an inflection point. Nothing makes so
            much sense without being surrounded by loved ones. They want to
            change the world, of course, but mostly for the people who live in
            it.</span
