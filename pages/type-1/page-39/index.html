                  Enneagram type 1 wing 9 is a very sensitive kind that can
                  easily catch all the negativity and conflicts to better avoid
                  them. If you want to motivate an Idealist, you need to
                  identify what worries them and makes them feel unpleasant.
                  Having their feelings validated is very important for them to
                  be healthy and unfold their brightness.

                  They want to devote their life to something meaningful.
                  Whatever they do, they give themselves out to make positive
                  and structural changes. Enneagram type 1 wing 9s will use
                  discernment to make big decisions at work. If they feel
                  supported, they freshen up the room. Some careers they may
                  follow are Judge, Social Worker, Environmentalist, Guidance
                  Counselor, Journalist, Public Relations Specialist,
                  Consultant, and Ambassador.

                  Under stress the Enneagram type 1 wing 9 can be insecure. If
                  they feel they are not making a difference, or if people are
                  constantly correcting them and pointing out their faults, they
                  can be too tough on themselves. This can become a vicious
                  cycle. Recognition and organization will tame their spirit.
