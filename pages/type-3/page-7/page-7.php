            The Achiever is really motivated by success. It’s their happiness, their true life goal, the very thing that
            pushes them forward.
            <br /><br />
            Enneagram Type 3, seem unstoppable and it’s kinda true. Nothing could stop them unless they want.
            <br /><br />
            Enneagram Type Threes are aware of their virtues, and what they are good at. False modesty is not really
            their thing. They like to talk about their achievements, duties, dreams and how close they are to reaching
            them but not in a pretentious way. Type Threes are just really committed to their energy and purpose.

            “If I do it right and I succeed I’ll be worth it.”
            <br /><br />
            Enneagram 3s want to feel valuable and accepted. The only way they know to achieve that is by living an
            extraordinary life.
            <br /><br />
            Self value is a merit that will increase upon their success. The Achiever plans ahead, aims towards their
            goals, and works hard to stand out in what they do.
            <br /><br />
            They are very self oriented and pragmatic, which makes it easy for them to triumph. The only thing that
            makes Enneagram Type 3s un-functional is that sometimes they ignore their feelings as they believe feelings
            delay their action and could potentially distract them. As a consequence, Type 3s end up feeling
            disconnected from their deeper interests.
