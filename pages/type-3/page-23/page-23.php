                            Getting to know your Enneagram compatibility with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it
                            gives different inputs into your relationship and lead to new levels of healthiness.
                            <br /><br />
                            However, it is important to know that no pairing of types is particularly blessed or ruined:
                            knowing these combinations will help you understand some of the different features that may
                            come from the mix between two different types.
                            <br /><br />
                            @name keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            When it comes to similarities, both Enneagram type 3 and Enneagram type 1 (Reformers) are
                            idealistic, serious-minded and competent. This Enneagram compatibility is task-oriented and
                            both sides are driven to working. They are constantly aware of their own high expectations
                            and standards.
                            <br /><br />
                            Both types can provide self-discipline, hard work, and an amazing ability to put aside their
                            personal feelings for the sake of their goals. They are so used to working hard that they
                            usually prosper, which makes everyone around admire them and leads them to leadership roles
                            with lots of responsibility. This goal- oriented match strives for excellence and therefore
                            they are extraordinarily competent and impressive.
                            <br /><br />
                            These skills are useful when it comes to practical matters, such as planning and organizing,
                            as they can objectively assign responsibilities according to peopleâ€™s abilities. This mixed
                            pair is capable of dealing with everything. They will try to solve personal problems by
                            discussing specific issues as neither of them likes emotionally charged arguments or
                            unresolved arguments.
                            <br /><br />
                            Type 1s help type 3s to be more grounded and realistic; while Threes teach Ones to not be
                            such perfectionists. This is a romantic match in which both sides are persistent, efficient
                            and concerned with excellence and making a real difference in the world.
