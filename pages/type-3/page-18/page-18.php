            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    A high self-esteem is Enneagram type 3’s main attribute. All the other types look at them wishing
                    they had the same sense of personal worth Type 3s have. The rest of the earthlings have it hard
                    sometimes so they see The Achiever as a model, an inspiration. And that’s because they’re always
                    moving towards their goals.
                    <br /><br />
                    Enneagram 3s are quite aware of their virtues and limitations and they don’t take them seriously (or
                    at least it would seem so). But the one thing people don’t know is that it’s hard to be a Type
                    Three.

                Constantly wondering whether they will be able to fulfill the image they made of themselves. What happens if the Achiever doesn’t reach the purposes they set for themselves?

                    Sometimes that high self-esteem could rise up to the sky and a Enneagram type 3s could feel like
                    Daenerys without the dragons. This overreaction to their self perception could make them constantly
                    compare themselves to others.
                    <br /><br />
                    In the average behavior, Type 3s are ambitious, always seeking a high status. But they also feel
                    insecure, and the more they do the more they self promote themselves.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Achiever hides their true needs thinking that maybe if they can convince other people of their
                    value they can convince themselves too.
