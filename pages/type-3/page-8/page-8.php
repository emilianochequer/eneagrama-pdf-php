            <p class="love-must-be-the">
                Enneagram 3s are seductive and constantly trying to emphasize their high qualities. They show themselves
                to others as exceptional and unreachable like a star, but they are thirsty for attention and
                admiration.<br />
                <br />
                Enneagram type 3, can approach love with the same goal-oriented mindset that they apply to other areas
                of their life. They may seek out partners who can help them achieve their personal or professional
                goals, or who they perceive as successful and accomplished. They may also try to present themselves in
                the best possible light to their partner, putting their best foot forward and trying to impress them.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, this focus on achievement and success can sometimes come at the expense of emotional intimacy
                and authenticity. Enneagram 3s may struggle to open up about their true feelings or vulnerabilities,
                instead prioritizing their image and reputation. They may also struggle with feelings of inadequacy or
                fear of failure, which can make it difficult for them to fully trust and connect with their partner.
                <br />
                <br />
                Type Threes want to be unforgettable. Despite acting like they donâ€™t need anyone, they are scared of
                connecting deeply with other people so they try to not get involved with them or to hide their feelings.
                Type Threes also believe that their emotions might hold them back from achieving their goals, which is
                not practical and can affect their effectiveness.
