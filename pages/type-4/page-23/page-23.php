                            with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it gives different inputs into your relationship and
                            lead to new levels of healthiness. However, it is important to know that no pairing of types
                            is particularly blessed or ruined: knowing these combinations will help you understand some
                            of the different features that may come from the mix between two different types.
                            <br /><br />
                            @name keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            Enneagram type 4s and Enneagram type 1s (Reformers) have a mutual interest in giving
                            something beautiful to the world. Both of them are dreamy, idealistic and are really
                            concerned about doing their work and self-expressions well. They are visionaries that look
                            at projects or things and imagine how they could be different and even be better if things
                            go as planned. If they work together, it could result in something limitless, magic and
                            transcendent.
                            <br /><br />
                            On one hand, Enneagram type 1s usually offer truth, objectivity, reasoning and value to the
                            relationship. They also bring self-discipline, good work habits, and regularity. Ones are
                            aware of their own needs and change them for the greater good, a specific vision or goal
                            (including the ones they see as the core of the relationship itself.)
                            <br /><br />
                            On the other hand, Fours bring in all their sensuality, spontaneity, creativity,
                            inspiration, intense feelings, and the power of the unconscious. Their sensitivity and
                            emotions can balance One’s typical formality and sense of order as they give One a
                            permission to explore and fully express the variety of feelings and passions within them.
                            Generally speaking, Ones bring boundaries and self-restraint to the relationship, which can
                            work as a role model for Fours, who tend to be more unregulated.
                            <br /><br />
                            Both Enneagram types have a taste for refinement, beauty and arts, and if both value what
                            the other has to offer, they can form a long-lasting and productive bond that helps balance
                            each side’s limitations while bringing out qualities each of them lacks.
