            The Individualist is constantly in a trance of feelings, surfing their moods and emotions. They look alike,
            it’s easy to perceive who they are upon evoking their feelings.
            <br /><br />
            Enneagram type 4s are very sensitive and humane, which can be intense. That’s a high quality of theirs and
            it teaches them a lot about life, which leads Type 4s to think there’s no need to go out and try for
            themselves. Withdrawing from the world feels safer for Type Fours, they can watch and gaze from their self
            spaces and interpret reality with the filter of their own melancholy.
            <br /><br />
            Type Fours project stories, romances and events like a Bat-signal. Suddenly, they can’t go out. They need to
            stay inside to keep learning and imagining, living the virtual life which they feel identified with. The
            Individualist’s feelings are their motivation.

            Enneagram Type Fours feel they are only worth it if they are faithful to themselves. But, who are they? Type
            4s are people that like to fantasize and imagine stories. Who live in a place where things are well under
            control and reactions are well-managed. What happens if they go out and do something unexpected, how would
            they deal with it? Will they be consistent? Will they repeat themselves or be someone else? What happens if
            a Type Four discovers new reactions, new feelings, new ways that wash them away from the shore?
            <br /><br />
            That’s scary and an unnecessary risk so they withdraw to their inner self. The Individualist has an amazing
            and singular ability to connect to their feelings, and that power is hard to manage. I understand them, but
            sometimes because they identify with their feelings they get too attached to them. Type 4s are way more than
            they feel. Taking their feelings and displaying them into something creative could be a great chance to
            channel these feelings and to open the way to Type Fours’ core.
