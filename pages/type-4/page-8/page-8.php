            Type 4s are hopeless romantics. They should definitely consider the option to sell their mental scripts to some soap opera channel. They are losing money if they don’t. This sounds funny but it’s also how Enneagram Type 4s treasure themselves very very deeply, where storms break out under the sun. When they finally get into their own love story, they’re intense. 
            <br /><br />
Enneagram 4, is a personality type that can be intense and passionate in romantic relationships. They are known for their deep and complex emotions and often feel things very intensely. Enneagram 4s have a strong sense of what they want in a partner and in a relationship, and they may have high standards for themselves and their partner. They value authenticity and are typically attracted to partners who are genuine and true to themselves.
Enneagram 4s are often creative and express their emotions through art, music, or other creative outlets. However, they may struggle in relationships where they feel like they have to be someone they're not in order to fit in or please their partner.
<br /><br />
Type Fours deploy a wide arsenal of seductive and powerful energy. They want to take reality as the higher expression of a virtual fantasy. Carrying that romantic empowerment they could step into possessiveness and jealousy. The fear of losing that someone they finally found and that cares about them, drives Type 4s a little euphoric and dependent. Sometimes they put onto their loving partner the ideal of love they’ve created for themselves. Deep inside what they want is a savior. Someone who offers them their shoulders, where they can pour out all their vulnerability. Someone to be a refuge for hostility. Overall, Enneagram 4s are deeply emotional and passionate in love, valuing authenticity, creativity, and idealism in their romantic relationships.
