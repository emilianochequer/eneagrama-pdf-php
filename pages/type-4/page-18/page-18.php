            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    Going inwards, through the large mind halls full of memories and labyrinths can be fruitful but
                    addictive too. Although introspection is a proven way of self knowledge it is something that becomes
                    comfortable and bittersweet at the same time.
                    <br /><br />
                    As long as 4s know themselves better, they will learn good and maybe not-so-good things about
                    themselves. Considering they are beauty seekers, this could be really tough. Maybe they will start
                    comparing themselves to others, only to get to the conclusion that they are flawed, broken,
                    different or special. Heaven and hell coexist inside everyone. While some of us run out of ourselves
                    to avoid facing the truth, Type 4s run right into it. The only problem is when they build a version
                    of themselves to protect them from their true self, since they think they are weak and can drive
                    themselves to dangerous fields. Trusting who they are, their natural self, without getting lured by
                    a singing mermaid is their great challenge.

                    Enneagram 4 act like a self guardian, like a protector of their innocence and emotions. They feel
                    everything intensely, always cultivating something inside of them, unsure if anyone out there will
                    be truly able to support and understand them properly. It’s better to stand by themselves and not
                    ask for any help or compassion because they believe no one could help them.
                    <br /><br />
                    Type 4s are different. Their inner trips are special, chaotic and surreal. They naturally manifest
                    their inner world into artistic creations, and try to smooth their environment with aesthetic
                    details because Fours are hypersensitive and everything wakes up their feelings. So they interiorize
                    those feelings and tend to take things personally.
