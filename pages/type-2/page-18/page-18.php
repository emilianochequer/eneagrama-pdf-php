            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    of Enneagram 2’s empathy comes from knowing how it feels to be alone, to need someone or something.
                    They would do anything to prevent other people from living in pain or solitude. But, on the other
                    hand, the Helper ends up feeling like a savior. They feel they must understand and justify other
                    people’s actions and save them. That magnitude of compassion is amazing but can be harmful too,
                    because it turns other people into victims so it can override them.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Helper understands that although healing is a collective process, each person is responsible for
                    their own healing.</span></span>

                    In the average status, Enneagram 2s are concerned about their relationships. They spend so much time
                    thinking about what to do to get closer to the people they love, and sometimes they plan big
                    gestures to show their affection.That’s because they love to show love but also because they want to
                    make sure that they’re doing enough to be loved back.
                    <br /><br />
                    This could affect Type 2s spontaneity and lead them to suppress their real reactions in order to
                    always please others. They worry about doing something wrong and giving other people reasons to not
                    love them anymore.
                    <br /><br />
                    Anyway, most of the time people feel really comfortable around an Enneagram type 2. They are
                    generous, empathetic and really good listeners.
