                                Enneagram Type 2 like you, are dedicated and principled employees
                                who value order and structure in their work environments. They
                                have a strong sense of personal responsibility and strive to live
                                up to their high moral standards.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                In the workplace, Enneagram 1s may excel in roles that require
                                attention to detail, analytical thinking, and problem-solving
                                abilities. They are often highly organized and focused, and can be
                                counted on to meet deadlines and produce high-quality work.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                At the same time, Enneagram 1s may struggle with perfectionism and
                                a tendency towards black-and-white thinking. They may have
                                difficulty accepting criticism or feedback and may be highly
                                critical of themselves and others.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Enneagram 1s may also struggle with flexibility and adaptability
                                in the face of change. They may have a strong attachment to
                                established routines and processes and may be resistant to new
                                ideas or approaches.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                In the workplace, Enneagram 1s may thrive in environments that
                                value integrity, accountability, and attention to detail. They may
                                struggle in situations where there is ambiguity or a lack of clear
                                guidelines.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Overall, Enneagram 1s are highly principled and dedicated
                                employees who value structure and order in their work
                                environments. They may struggle with perfectionism and a
                                reluctance to adapt to change, but with support and encouragement,
                                they can be highly effective and productive members of a team.
