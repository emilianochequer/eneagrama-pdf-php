                            with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it gives different inputs into your relationship and
                            lead to new levels of healthiness.
                            <br /><br />
                            However, it is important to know that no pairing of types is particularly blessed or ruined:
                            knowing these combinations will help you understand some of the different features that may
                            come from the mix between two different types.
                            <br /><br />
                             <?= $user['first_name']; ?>   keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            Enneagram type 2s (Helpers) and Enneagram type 1s (Reformers) are a complementary match as
                            both of them offer each other a taste of their own traits. Both are achievers that are drawn
                            to jobs or roles that allow them to help others.
                            <br /><br />
                            They generally work as teachers, ministers or health care volunteers, who work long hours,
                            put up with a lot of pressure and have a lot of responsibility on their shoulders. These
                            types of couples are often made of professionals who aren’t home for most of the day,
                            sometimes even a few days. Their usually focus mostly on their occupation, even more so than
                            the relationship itself.
                            <br /><br />
                            This Enneagram compatibility often involve mature and independent people that are able to
                            fulfill their emotional needs by bonding with a variety of people and connections, including
                            their professional ones. They usually provide high ideals, strong ethical standards, and a
                            strong desire to serve others. Since the relationship is built on the basis of these values
                            (both are sort of on the same path) it’s easier for them to keep a strong relationship
                            that’s in constant touch with solid values and practical perspectives.
                            <br /><br />
                            Enneagram type Twos provides the care and the feelings that type Ones don’t easily allow
                            themselves to have. Twos are also more welcoming than Ones and can warm up even the most
                            reserved kinds. They bring not only warmth to the table, but are also aware of suffering and
                            work hard and generously to help people in need: they definitely help reformers soften up
                            and relax.
                            <br /><br />
                            Ones, on the other hand, bring integrity, consciousness, commitment, and consistency since
                            they are steady, reliable, and truthful. Ones commit strongly, which makes Twos feel calm
                            and secure.
