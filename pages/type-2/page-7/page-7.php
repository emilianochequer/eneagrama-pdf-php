            For the Helper there’s nothing more important than love, or even better said “being loved”.
            <br /><br />
            As Bob Marley sings: “Could you be loved and be loved?”. They are always wondering if their significant
            other love them as much as they hope they do, or even more than that.
            <br /><br />

            Sometimes Enneagram 2s feel a subtle fear, will people stay around if they are not making the effort to feel
            loved too? Enneagram type 2s feel like people expect them to help, to be generous, to support them. That
            makes them feel good with themselves and worthy of love.
            <br /><br />

            They see the needs of people around them and feel it’s their duty to fulfill them.

            Enneagram type Two, believe everything is ok when they are being loved. Of course, we all want and need love
            and to feel loved, but we can’t let other people define our value; type 2s think that the more they
            sacrifice themselves for others the more they are worthy of love. Love is sacrifice, abnegation.
            <br /><br />
            For Enneagram 2s, thinking and taking care of their needs is unfair, selfish and unacceptable. Being selfish
            is the worst thing they can think of, and they believe nobody loves someone like that. Everything in their
            life is divided into two opposing sides: being good and helpful (+) or being selfish and only thinking about
            yourself (-).
            <br /><br />
            The Helper feels that being loved requires renouncing to themselves but deep inside they know it’s not a
            selfless resignation, there’s an implied price within the action itself.
