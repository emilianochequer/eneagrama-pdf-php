            <h1 class="page-8-text-wrapper">How do you Love?</h1>
            <p class="love-must-be-the">
                Have you ever heard that song by The Cardigans: “love me, love me, say that you love me”?.
                <br /><br />
                Well, I’ll take the risk of saying that this song was written by a Two Type, just for this part: “Just
                say that you need me, I can’t care ’bout anything but you”.
                <br /><br />
                In the love field, type 2s are passionate and give everything to their beloved ones. They enjoy long and
                deep conversations that open the way to what is intimate and most treasured by the other, that’s the
                most certain way to connect and win their trust and love.
                <br /><br />
                That’s the best way to ensure there is a solid relationship between the Helper and their significant
                other. So, Enneagram type 2s usually seduce people by paying special attention to them. If they feel
                they are losing their beloved person they can become really possessive and intense by doing whatever
                they can to keep people close.
                <br /><br />
                To feel the right to ask something back, they do more valuable things, so it seems like the other person
                is in debt with them. These attitudes can be born from an unconscious state of mind which supports old
                beliefs that sustain dependent relationships.
