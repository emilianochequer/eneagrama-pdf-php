            The truth is – drum roll – nobody can hurt Sixes. Their strengths, their restless pursuit of a place to call
            home, is like the light of a star that travels through space to reach the unknown.
            <br /><br />
            All they have been through shows that Type 6s can deal with anything, but they better work when they are
            open-hearted. Nobody knows what is ahead of us.
            <br /><br />
            To let go of the rope and lower their defenses, Enneagram 6s just need to feel supported.
            <br /><br />
            To finally find that place or person that makes them feel safe. But the problem is that they won’t find
            anything genuine by being defensive. Taking the risk is too much just yet.

            “It’s either one way or the other, there’s no middle ground” – That’s Enneagram 6s motto.
            <br /><br />
            Although that works well for the rest of the people, Sixes are different. They try to fit in a certain fixed
            position, but their willingness to find out the truth, what’s right and safe gets the bouncing from place to
            place, losing their well-known steadiness. They have the right to doubt everything, nothing can control them
            unless they allow it.
            <br /><br />
            In other words, the Loyalist is like Hannah Montana: they get the best of both worlds going back and forth
            between two poles, afraid to stay in the wrong place while slowly dying.
            <br /><br />
            The self-image they have is both weak and strong, capable and powerless, passive and aggressive, and so on.
