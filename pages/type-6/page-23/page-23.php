                            Getting to know your Enneagram compatibility with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it
                            gives different inputs into your relationship and lead to new levels of healthiness.
                            <br /><br />
                            However, it is important to know that no pairing of types is particularly blessed or ruined:
                            knowing these combinations will help you understand some of the different features that may
                            come from the mix between two different types.
                            <br /><br />
                             <?= $user['first_name']; ?>   keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            Enneagram type 1 (Reformers) and Enneagram type 6, are similar in many ways. They are
                            usually recognized for being hard-workers, serious-minded people with a strong sense of duty
                            and honor. They both honor truth and commitment, and they also desire to serve people around
                            them and make the world a better place. These Enneagram types have a strong sense of
                            purpose, often led by strong beliefs and ideals.
                            <br /><br />
                            On one hand, Ones bring reasoning, calmness and clarity to the relationship, along with the
                            ability to think clearly under pressure and the ability to make big decisions quickly. They
                            are pretty sure of themselves and their opinions; so, Enneagram type 1s often serve as the
                            leader in a One-Six relationship. They’re the ones in charge of decision making and are
                            responsible for any eventual results that might come from it. They also bring a concern for
                            order and consistency, logic and elegance (traits that Enneagram type 6 might lack).
                            <br /><br />
                            On the other hand, Loyalists bring warmth, emotional responsibility, generosity and
                            playfulness, which Reformers think it’s adorable and makes them think twice about their
                            mindsets. They also have the ability to connect with people in a more direct and human way
                            than Reformers. If their fundamental beliefs are in alignment, these qualities are really
                            attractive to Reformers and can make this couple a dynamic and stable one.
                            <br /><br />
                            This couple really takes responsibility in relationships and, as they can count on each
                            other, they have room to relax. This romantic match not only shares burdens and chores
                            equally, but they also feel that they can count on each other since they are steadfast,
                            loyal, and faithful to each other.
