            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                The Loyalist is the one that truly and firmly stands for their values. Deep down, they are true dreamers

                    The Enneagram 6 needs to trust and feel safe, so they measure the world and other people by what
                    they think will keep them out of danger.
                    <br /><br />
                    To better read situations and people, the Enneagram type Six uses their accurate sense of
                    perception, but they can also be very suspicious when they get anxious.
                    <br /><br />
                    In an average state, Enneagram Type 6s look for supportive people but at the same time they are
                    afraid of losing their independence.
                    <br /><br />
                    That fine balance is hard to get because it may turn into a power competition since they are
                    paranoid they might be deceived.
                    <br /><br />
                    Sixes analytic skills keep them always one step ahead so they feel prepared and safe for anything
                    that might happen, even the worst case scenario.
                    <br /><br />
                    Slowly, Type 6s get into a constant alarm state that makes them defensive and react aggressively.
