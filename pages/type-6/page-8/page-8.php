            <p class="love-must-be-the">
                In the field of love Enneagram 6s are like a peacock.
                <br /><br />
                Hey, don’t underestimate the sexual power of a peacock. Their special plumage is designed to attract
                their potential mate’s attention. When Sixes like someone they show out their virtues and securities and
                display themselves with extreme care for their appearance, irradiating security and a challenging
                attitude against authority.
                <br /><br />
                Usually, Type 6s look up to powerful figures that inspire them and they measure themselves with them.
                They like to know where people stand so they’re constantly proving themselves to them and to themselves
                as well.
                <br /><br />
                Sometimes, when anxious or under stress, Enneagram Sixes react against people that support them which
                could hurt their relationship. Deeply, Type 6s are saying “Love me and I’ll be yours”, but sometimes
                it’s hard for other people to get to them, since they keep them distant hoping to be in control.
