                            with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it gives different inputs into your relationship and
                            lead to new levels of healthiness. However, it is important to know that no pairing of types
                            is particularly blessed or ruined: knowing these combinations will help you understand some
                            of the different features that may come from the mix between two different types.
                            <br /><br />
                            @name keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            Enneagram type 7s and Enneagram type 1 (Reformers) can easily achieve a complementary and
                            reciprocal relationship. They are kind of opposite poles that can either provide something
                            their partner lacks, helping both of them to achieve a new level of growth or, in the
                            worst-case scenario, drive each other apart by playing around with each other’s weaknesses.
                            <br /><br />
                            Reformers bring dutifulness, order, steadiness, attention to detail, and a profound
                            appreciation for high standards to the relationship. While Enthusiasts bring curiosity,
                            energy, fun and adventure. And also, a desire to live new experiences and give everything
                            they can a try. Both of them love planning. They are future-oriented and idealistic.
                            However, Enneagram type 7s prefer having a wide range of options and keep all plans open to
                            change whenever they need to. They bring spontaneity and freedom to the relationship. As
                            opposed to Enneagram type 1s more methodical manners that help Enneagram type 7s stay on
                            track.
                            <br /><br />
                            Enthusiasts offer Reformers excitement and the ability to think of life as a source of
                            pleasure and enjoyment, not just work. Enthusiasts maintain Reformers’ spirits up,
                            refreshing their idealism while preventing the relationship from getting too intense.
                            Reformers offer Enthusiasts a sense of perfection, idealism and direction. They help Sevens
                            get stable while they keep on working systematically and consistently toward goals.
                            Enthusiasts appreciate their partner’s harmony and reliability and are glad to have someone
                            who can keep an eye on details.<br /><br /></span>
