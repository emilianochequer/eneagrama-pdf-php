            <h1 class="page-8-text-wrapper">How do you Love?</h1>
            <p class="love-must-be-the">
                Enneagram 7s approach love with excitement and optimism, seeking partners who share their sense of
                adventure and are willing to explore the world with them.
                <br /><br />
                Love can be the most attractive thing for Enneagram type 7s. It feels like the first love, when your
                life story becomes a movie you watch in the front row seat. All those incredible feelings while
                “Fireworks” by Katy Perry plays in the background. Do you often get lost in love fields? Does everything
                run fast and intense like the trilogy of Before Sunrise? Or do you want to live a love story like that
                one? Sights! That’s what 7s look like! And they should be glad.
                <br /><br />
                They value their independence and autonomy, which may sometimes cause them to struggle with feeling
                trapped or limited by their partner. Enneagram 7s love spontaneity and may surprise their partner with
                unexpected adventures or activities. However, they may also struggle with committing to one person or
                relationship for an extended period of time, fearing they might miss out on other experiences or
                opportunities.
                <br /><br />
                Enneagram 7s seek pleasure and may avoid conflict, which can make it challenging for them to express
                their true feelings and be vulnerable with their partners. Overall, Enneagram 7s bring joy and
                enthusiasm to their relationships, but they may need to work on finding a balance between independence
                and intimacy and being more honest with their partners.
                <br /><br />
                They are huge fans of love since it represents the plenitude of life and it gives them unbelievable
                shots of energy to face life as it should be faced. But as soon as their idealization approaches
                reality, they can feel really disappointed and alone. It’s hard to compromise and stand by something
                that ‘s not exactly as you imagined.
