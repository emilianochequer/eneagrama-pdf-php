            Satisfaction and joy. Life is beautiful, mysterious and infinite. In some way Enneagram Type 7s can’t stand
            the idea of leaving this world without seeing everything around and finding what’s out there for them.
            <br /><br />
            Every single moment of pain is even more painful if they think it’s a waste of time. As Sevens fight against
            those feelings, anxiety cheerfully escalates in their mind just like king kong escalated the Empire State
            building. Actions are slower than thoughts, which in the Enthusiasts’ case seem to travel in a bullet train.
            Very used to that rhythm, their thoughts can lose track since they don’t really know what to pay attention
            to first. Everything seems so amazing and valuable!
            <br /><br />
            Always dancing to Celia Cruz’s song, Enneagram Type 7s feel like life is a carnival and pain goes away just
            by singing or thinking about newer and challenging ideas. It’s such a pity that they need to sleep, uh?
            C’mon evolution!

            Let’s go back to the King Kong’s scene. Enneagram 7s may be wondering why on earth that’s useful? And
            they’re right, it’s not. At all. I just wanted to show them how obsessed they are with doing only useful
            things. “Relax and keep reading, Seven”. Back to the scene. There is something we can highlight: the Empire
            State of mind.
            <br /><br />
            With Type 7s highly stimulated, resourceful and out-of-hand mind, every seed seems to grow on their soil.
            But seeds can also perish while Sevens go for another crazy idea that very same seed brought to their mind.
            Experiences are the wind that blows Type 7s mind, they feel easily amazed by worldly things.
            <br />
            The Enthusiasts’ eyes, like the ones of a scientist, observe everything around them honestly thirst for
            knowledge. “Welcome to the circus of life!” Said the doctor who once brought a Seven to this world. Well, it
            was “circle”, but Seven obviously misheard it.
