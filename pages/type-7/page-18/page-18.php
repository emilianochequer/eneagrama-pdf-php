            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    Is there anything worse than routine to Type 7s? Boredom? Well, that too. But their main fear, the
                    very
                    thing that scares them to their bones, is something else. Something that is always out there and
                    Sevens are
                    constantly afraid of getting close to it: Living a miserable, boring, common, meaningless life.
                    <br /><br />
                    So, whatever takes Enneagram type 7s far from that dreadful life sounds ok to them even though it
                    might take
                    them apart from themselves too. That’s a price Enthusiasts are willing to pay. However, when things
                    go well,
                    they can thrive, flourish and lighten up every place they go to. Sevens get satisfaction and grace
                    from each
                    thing they do, as they choose to do them with awareness and are focused on what they want.

                    In the average state it’s easy to get excited with new projects. Sevens’ mind picture incredibly
                    funny scenarios, things they got to try, places they want to go to and so on. Life is promising.
                    <br /><br />
                    That gets Type 7s high for a while but, everything that goes up must come down eventually. They hate
                    the low downs, the flat zones. So, as soon as they start feeling trapped by boredom or time, they
                    take a deep breath and run back like a thunder. The good thing is that their sparkling energy
                    usually takes them to interesting places where their eyes always find nurturing experiences they can
                    learn from.
                    <br /><br />
                    If 7s allow themselves to stare, great things can grow up from that. Their agile mind, always
                    looking for beauty and pleasure, is able to create those experiences too.
