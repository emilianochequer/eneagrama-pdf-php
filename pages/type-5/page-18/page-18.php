            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    In good times, Enneagram Type 5s can be participative, able to enlighten people with their ways and
                    how they communicate. They can show their full potential, and be a visionaire. Type 5s just need to
                    stop fighting with their own doubts and trying to prove their worth. That’s when they better explore
                    their capacities.
                    <br /><br />
                    In bad times, Five’s are lost in paranoid thoughts where everything’s threatening. Like a halloween
                    town, they live among ghosts and scary visions of themselves and others. They run from everybody and
                    do everything they can to disappear. The mind is truly powerful, isn’t it? The Investigator is
                    capable of doing a lot of things in a wide spectrum: they could be a supernova or a black hole.

                    On the average state Type 5s are like an old man that scares away kids that are just playing in his
                    front yard: “Get out of here! You’re disturbing me, you lil’ demons!” Ok, not that antisocial but
                    they definitely don’t want to be distracted from their thoughts when they’re developing a big idea
                    or project.
                    <br /><br />
                    Enneagram Fives think people won’t understand things even if they explain it, and explaining takes
                    way too much time, so they just withdraw from the world. Like a crazy scientist, Type 5s keep on
                    insisting and trying different solutions. They study and think of ways to reach their goal more
                    effectively. For them It’s disturbing how people attach to old beliefs, so breaking them every once
                    in a while can be fun.
                    <br /><br />
                    Like Doctor Emmet Brown, the Investigator thinks that “If you put your mind to it, you can
                    accomplish anything” and nothing can stop you. There’s no pain, no limitations, no nos.
