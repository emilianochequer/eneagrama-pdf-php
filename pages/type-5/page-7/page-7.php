        <div
            class="type-5-page-7-text-motivates">
            Being useful, competent, capable of something great. Leaving their mark. These are the things that keep
            Enneagram 5s’ sparkle burning. In depth, they hate the idea of being a useless good-for-nothing, and that’s
            where their unstoppable effort to become an expert in things comes from. Or the need to unveil stuff that is
            buried to anyone else.
            <br /><br />
            Type 5s think they’re only worth it if they are capable, if they demonstrate how distinctive they are. But
            Five’s passion for exploring goes beyond and takes over everything.
            <br /><br />
            It’s their daily engine, and tell me if you don’t feel amazed when you get to incredible discoveries and new
            questions? Enneagram Type 5s inner world, the things that happen inside their mind, would blow other
            people’s minds but sometimes they get so deep within themselves that it’s difficult to share and relate with
            other human beings. I’m not saying Type Fives are reptilian, but I’m not saying they aren’t either.
            <br /><br />
            Pssst: if you are a reptilian tell me the secret of human evolution. I’m not asking too much, am I?

            class="p-6__the-reformer-s-principles-are-like-law-to-them-so-they-feel-the-need-to-follow-them-strictly-knowing-what-is-right-and-wrong-makes-enneagram-type-ones-very-practical-people-who-easily-know-what-to-do-although-this-could-also-drive-them-to-self-repression-to-get-what-needs-to-be-done-done-it-doesn-t-feel-bad-at-that-moment-since-enneagram-1-s-believe-their-worth-depends-on-doing-what-s-right-that-s-how-they-end-up-transferring-their-self-value-over-to-their-values-with-a-high-sense-of-justice-and-responsibility-enneagram-type-ones-stand-up-for-their-convictions-their-self-awareness-allows-them-to-be-reflexive-and-honest-with-themselves-even-though-they-tend-to-oversee-their-behavior-instead-of-having-a-compassionate-look-towards-themselves-somebody-has-to-do-it-to-keep-order">
            I don’t have a crystal ball, but I know that Type Fives are a little detached from their environment, like
            if they were hanging from a big balloon that keeps them living their adventure high up. I don’t blame them,
            it’s a wild world so withdrawing from it into better and imaginative places is a great option to preserve
            the mind.
            <br /><br />
            Nothing lasts forever, anyways, and someday something might pop Enneagram 5s’ balloon and they better get
            their tools to build a home on the ground. Their challenge? To enhance their natural abilities, their genius
            into a healthy balance with reality.
