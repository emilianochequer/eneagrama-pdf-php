            <h1 class="type-5-page-8-text-wrapper">How do you Love?</h1>
            <p class="type-5-page-8-love-must-be-the">
                If for some people love makes them walk on the moon, for you love is a bridge to reality. In fact, it’s
                the only way you choose to connect with reality. You look for a long lasting love, someone you could
                really trust on, someone special to share your insecurities and eccentricity with. Is easy for you to
                open your heart to your special someone, you become communicative and loyal.

                "The Investigator," tends to approach romantic relationships with a sense of curiosity and a desire to
                understand their partner on a deep level. They value their privacy and independence, and may need
                personal space and alone time to recharge their batteries and pursue their own interests. Individuals of
                this type are drawn to intellectual stimulation and enjoy deep conversations with their partner,
                exploring new ideas or topics together.
                <br /><br />
                However, they can also be emotionally reserved and struggle to express their feelings or needs to their
                partner. Despite this, they have a deep capacity for empathy and understanding and may be highly attuned
                to their partner's emotional needs.
                <br /><br />
                People of this type tend to avoid conflict and prefer harmony in their relationships, which can
                sometimes lead to passive-aggressive behavior or a tendency to withdraw from the relationship rather
                than addressing issues directly.
                <br /><br />
                Your strong sexuality encourages you to take the chance and let the other person enter your sacred
                world. When something makes you feel unsafe, you withdraw into your mind and disappear. It could be
                something baffling to the other person but sooner than later – if the relationship is worth it – you
                will try another way to manage that situation.
                <br /><br />
                Overall, individuals of this type can be thoughtful and loyal partners who value deep connections and
                intellectual stimulation, but may also need reassurance and support to fully open up and connect
                emotionally with their partner.
