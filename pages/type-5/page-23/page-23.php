                            with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it gives different inputs into your relationship and
                            lead to new levels of healthiness. However, it is important to know that no pairing of types
                            is particularly blessed or ruined: knowing these combinations will help you understand some
                            of the different features that may come from the mix between two different types.

                             <?= $user['first_name']; ?>   keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            Enneagram type 5 and Enneagram type 1 (Reformers) are alike in many ways, especially in
                            their reluctance to express their emotions directly. Although Fives are more mental and Ones
                            like their ideas and philosophies to have practical ramifications; both consider themselves
                            empirical people.
                            <br /><br />
                            They both provide objectivity to the relationship to avoid falling into sentimentalism.
                            That’ how they protect their mental clarity. Also, both of them share a rich mentally
                            stimulating life, full of curiosity and mutual interests.
                            <br /><br />
                            This is one of the many reasons Ones and Fives enjoy each other’s company. In their
                            relationship there’s always room for intellectual stimulation, debating and admiration for
                            each other’s expertise and intelligence. This couple is highly respectful of each other’s
                            boundaries: they don’t usually make the first move unless they have pretty strong signals
                            that they will be welcomed. This is how Ones and Fives bring certain formality and courtesy
                            to the relationship, which can make the couple seem a little old-fashioned.
                            <br /><br />
                            On one hand, Enneagram type 1s bring logic and order, attention to details, systematic
                            thinking, and a desire to improve the world around them. On the other hand, Enneagram type
                            5s bring curiosity, a profound taste for the bizarre and illogical and fondness for
                            disorder, chaos, and lack of apparent purpose. If romance between Reformers and
                            Investigators develops, it will be slowly but deeply.
