            The Enneagram personality method is the best way to face the challenge
            of making friends with ourselves. We are sick of running in circles,
            repeating our past as we run from it. As Einstein would say, if you want
            different results, do not do the same things. <br /><br />The Enneagram
            method helps us to highlight our inner system, the one that composes our
            matrix. If you’re looking to change your life, if you don’t want to be
            washed away by your feelings and thoughts, if you live your life
            dreaming of a different one… take a look at the following strategies to
            enhance Personal Growth.

                    Enneagram Type 9s empathy and inner peace make it easy for them to soften the tension and face drama because they don’t take things personally. People admire Enneagram Type 9s ability to support, heal and bring an optimistic vibe. But when it comes to themselves, sometimes their way of solving problems is just avoiding them or being complacent to other’s needs. Nines do whatever it takes to keep the peace and love structure around them. That’s cool! Not everything needs to be solved right away, but this can easily turn into a comfort zone where they stay paralized.</span></span>

                    Life is badly designed. Conflicts are really unnecessary. So, why pay attention to them? The more
                    Nines face them, the more their inner peace goes away.
                    <br /><br />
                    Enneagram Type 9s look like those cartoons that try to hold things up to keep them from falling by
                    using their whole bodies: nose, ears, mouth, hands and feet to hang glasses, forks, plates, spoons.
                    But it just takes a single blow to make everything fall apart! Living this way, avoiding all
                    problems can be exhausting and it takes a lot of self-repression. But it’s ok, Type 9s feel covered,
                    as long as things keep rolling calmly.
                    <br /><br />
                    Little by little, they put themselves last. Then they claim recognition, but there is no record of
                    their true feelings or needs so it’s hard to explain it to others.
