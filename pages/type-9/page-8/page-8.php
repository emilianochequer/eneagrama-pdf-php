            <h1 class="type-9-page-8-text-wrapper">How do you Love?</h1>
            <p class="love-must-be-the">
                Hopeless romantic, you use to merge with your lover. It’s easy to blend your life with the other’s
                feeling complete, like it was actually your half-watermelon (orange is too acidic for your sweetness).
                This kung-fusion can drive you to constant disappointment and depression because it’s just an
                idealization. You dissociate easily from yourself, losing your identity and feeling ashamed, insecure
                and in a sadness loop. As you see, love is too much turbulence for your balloon ride.
                <br /><br />
                When it comes to love, Type 9s value deep connections and seek partners who are supportive,
                understanding, and share their values. They are often willing to compromise and adapt to their partner's
                needs to maintain harmony in the relationship.
                <br /><br />
                The 9s are called the utopian because of their stubborness to maintain peace and harmony.
                In a romantic relationship, Type 9s may struggle with asserting their needs and wants, as they often
                prioritize the needs of their partner over their own. This can lead to a tendency to avoid conflict,
                which may cause them to suppress their own feelings and needs. Nines may also have a tendency to merge
                with their partner, losing their sense of self in the process.
                <br /><br />
                Love is always an intense bond, wave breaking, and this could destabilize you since you put so much
                effort to preserve serenity in the relationship. You usually avoid conflicts, flap them under the carpet
                and you give in, to comfort the other’s needs. Be clear with your limits, this will help you to avoid
                falling into abusive relationships and de-dramatize conflict, it’s ok not to agree with the other,
                conflicts when approached in good terms can be another way to deepen the bond.
                <br /><br />
                To improve their relationships, Type 9s may need to work on developing a stronger sense of self and
                communicating their needs and wants to their partner. They may also need to practice asserting
                themselves and standing up for their values, rather than avoiding conflict. By working on these areas,
                Type 9s can create more fulfilling and balanced relationships.
