                            with other Enneatypes can be helpful as it gives different inputs into your relationship and
                            lead to new levels of healthiness. However, it is important to know that no pairing of types
                            is particularly blessed or ruined: knowing these combinations will help you understand some
                            of the different features that may come from the mix between two different types.
                            <br /><br />
                            @name keep in mind that knowing what is an Enneagram and your Enneagram compatibility should
                            not determine how you like someone when meeting them for the first time. You can have a
                            relationship with any type as long as the two of you share similar ideas of what a healthy
                            relationship is and the same level of consciousness.

                            Enneagram type 9s and Enneagram type 1s (Reformers) understand each other from within and
                            can see many of their own traits in their partner, which can be a good or a bad thing. As
                            for the positive side of this connection, each Enneagram type brings a certain idealism and
                            a desire to change the world and make it a better place, as they are both hardworking types
                            that are willing to sacrifice themselves and put their personal needs aside for the sake of
                            others.
                            <br /><br />
                            Ones contribute with reasoning and clarity and their ability to articulate different ideals
                            into one. They are always looking for improvement, they are reasonable, fair, consistent and
                            have high ethical and moral standards. Also, Ones feel that they have a mission in life, and
                            they are able to inspire Nines to become aware of their own purpose and to follow it. While
                            Nines are easy to get along with, steady, and simple. As they are uncritical and
                            undemanding, they have the quality to nurture and support people around them without much
                            pressure.
                            <br /><br />
                            They prefer harmony and smooth relations over the pleasure of being right or having the last
                            word in an argument. This mix has what it takes to be an altruistic pair: a romantic match
                            that balances idealism and humanity. As a romantic couple, they feel pleased by having
                            company over and are always generous and friendly. However, they also value their time
                            together as a couple. They both enjoy nature and animals, as well as children and family.
