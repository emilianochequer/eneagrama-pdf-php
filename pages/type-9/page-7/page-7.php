            Peace of mind. Everyone wants that, but Type 9s are its first guardian. Nobody works harder than them to
            keep peace and serenity. Nines can’t stand tension and conflict. They have a bad time in that atmosphere.
            They feel nervous and distressed. It’s hard to live in that world, it’s a wild one. So Peacemakers realize
            that they feel safer surrounded by nice people. If people are ok, then so are you.
            <br /><br />
            What happens if everything turns bad and Enneagram Type 9s feel threatened? Would they be able to respond
            the way it takes? They are scared of facing that alone, stalked by danger. Madness and the world’s darkness
            freak Nines out, so they run to their safe space where everything is solved by singing hakuna matata.

            Hopeless romantic, Nines tend to merge with their lovers. It’s easy for them to blend their life with their
            significant other’s and feel complete as if that person was their half-watermelon (an orange is too bitter
            for 9’s sweetness). This kung-fusion can drive Type 9s to constant disappointment and depression because
            it’s just an idealization.
            <br /><br />
            They dissociate easily from themselves, losing their identity and feeling ashamed, insecure and in a sadness
            loop. As Nines see it, love is too much turbulence for their balloon ride.Enneagram 9s are called utopians
            because of their stubborness to maintain peace and harmony. Love is always an intense bond that could
            destabilize them since they put too much effort to preserve serenity in the relationship. They usually avoid
            conflicts by sweeping them under the rug and they give in, to comfort the other’s needs.
            <br /><br />
            The Peacemaker needs to be clear with their boundaries, this will help them avoid falling into abusive
            relationships and de-dramatizing conflict. It’s ok not to agree with others. Conflicts when well managed can
            be another way to deepen the bond.
